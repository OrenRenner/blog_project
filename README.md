# **Blog Project**

Welcome to the Blog project! This web application allows you to create and share interesting blog posts with others. You can tag your posts, enable commenting, and even share your favorite blogs via email. The project is built using Django 4 and uses PostgreSQL as the database, which can be easily set up with Docker Compose.
